Under RTE, every school has to admit 25% students from local areas at low fees. ""But this is a standalone academy recognised by the IB Organisation in Switzerland. The school gives a disclaimer that it is not recognised or affiliated to any board or university in India and hence cannot be subject to RTE,"" Sathe argued. Granting of recognition by the state authorities makes all students in such schools eligible for transfers and cross-admissions to other schools and for admission to higher education.Sathe said the school in Pune had its own curriculum and syllabus, and over 60% of its students were children of expats and the other 40% were locals who wished to go abroad for further studies. ""This is globalisation,"" said Sathe, when Chief Justice Chellur asked how a Swiss academy was setting up school ""on our land, using our resources.""The school run by Mercedes-Benz Education Academy was established in 1998 and has 280 students studying across primary, medium and diploma sections from ages 6 to 18.

The petition was filed through advocate Kiran Bapat in 2015 but was heard for the first time on Thursday .Lawyer Manisha Jagtap, representing the Centre, said there were eight to 10 IB schools in the state and they might seek similar relief. Sathe said there are ""only three pure IB schools in the country . The rest are hybrid schools which opt for IB later and they are recognised also as a school with the state or central board.

Last date for appeal is August 30 for this. Another student pleading anonymity said: ""Deadline for registration was August 10 and they took 16 days to tell us about termination. They have cited our non-registration as reason for termination. The fact remains, institute never allowed us to register in the first place. So how could have we go ourselves registered,"" he said. He added: ""On August 1, we were given notice for year-drop and today they are talking about our termination. Suddenly, year-drop turned into termination without prior information."" In frustration, 'harassed' students have started leaving the campus. ""This is a research institute.

"To fill IIT faculty gaps, PhD entry for BTechs",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/To-fill-IIT-faculty-gaps-PhD-entry-for-BTechs/articleshow/53802875.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the IIT council meeting next week, HRD ministry will propose a new research scholar scheme that proposes to identify 1,000 bright BTech students from premier engineering colleges who can be admitted straight into PhD programmes. Sources said that ""IITs will be asked if it is possible to get exceptional students into PhD immediately after BTech"". It would also be proposed that ""BTech passouts from IITs who have job experience and are interested in research should be enrolled in PhD,"" they added. A ministry official said the larger idea is to solve the problem of faculty crunch in IITs. He said it is ironical that despite around 2,000 PhDs coming out of IITs each year, the same number of vacancies exist. ""When it comes to hiring teachers, IITs are very selective. The need is to improve the quality of PhD and attract bright IIT students to undertake research,"" a source said. To make PhD after BTech attractive, government proposes to offer hefty scholarships to students. ""It will not be big enough to compensate the salary a IIT student gets after BTech but it will probably be among the highest,"" one official said. The Anil Kakodkar Committee report on IITs had recommended that each IIT should progressively grow to have around 1,200 faculty (from around 500 today) and closer to 12,000 students with maximum growth coming from an enhanced number of PhD students. It had suggested a minimum of 0.6 PhDs per faculty annually, eventually reaching 1 PhD per faculty. On this basis, the committee had suggested that the IIT system should be scaled to 16,000 faculty and 1,60,000 total student strength (with 40,000 at the PhD level, 40,000 at the Masters level and 80,000 UG students) by around the year 2020."

Foreign students complain that it be allowed,"" he said.Pandey also points out that since KHS pays for the annual ticket home for foreign students, bookings are done in advance according to the yearly academic calendar."

Thousands apply for handful of seats left in Delhi University colleges,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Thousands-apply-for-handful-of-seats-left-in-Delhi-University-colleges/articleshow/53426170.cms,"NEW DELHI: It's a deluge Delhi University (DU) colleges were clearly not prepared for. They had invited applications for a handful of seats left unfilled after the fifth cutoff list admissions. What they got in response were a mindboggling tens of thousands of applications for seats ranging from a few dozen to a few hundred. Hans Raj College, for instance, is saddled with 84,000 applications for the 50 seats it needs to fill up. That's 1,680 candidates per seat. Similarly, Ramjas has 57,000 applicants for 100 seats and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya 37,000 applications for 25-odd seats. Lady Shri Ram College has to contend with 1,800 aspirants for six seats in the psychology programme.While colleges were supposed to issue the merit list by 5pm on Wednesday, a majority of them were at their wit's end on how to work out a merit list from such big database at such short notice. Some blamed the University for not processing the data properly. According to an official from the dean of stu dents' welfare, 17-odd colleges received over 40,000 applications while another nine got over 20,000 applications.Such is the demand all colleges are overwhelmed with applications. Hindu college, for instance, has received over 5,000 applications for six seats in BCom (H). ""We are working on the data. The numbers are huge. And we have to work out a merit list only based on the number of seats available,"" said Anju Srivastava, principal, Hindu College.Another north campus college with over 40,000 applications is Kirori Mal College. It has close to 300 seats under all categories still unfilled.""LSR received 1,811 applications for the six general category seats in psychology. We never imagined such big numbers. That makes our work even tougher to prepare a merit list. We will go step wise, as directed by the university. In case of the best-of-four scores being the same, we will have to consider the overall class XII aggregate,"" said Kanika Ahuja, media coordinator, LSR.What's troubling many colleges is that many applicants have already secured a seat in a DU college. As soon as the unfilled seats status was announced, these students applied to other colleges and courses without withdrawing from the course they are enrolled in. ""The problem is that if these students are offered seats, their current seats will fall vacant and it will only prolong the admission process,"" said a principal of a south Delhi college.""Initially candidates were not allowed to apply without cancelling their admission in other colleges, "" the principal said. ""Some of them came to us seeking an assurance that they would get the seat in case they cancel. That's something we can't promise. Only students from St Stephen's and Jesus and Mary, as they are not part of DU's centralised admission process, were allowed to apply without cancelling their admissions. Later, the DSW office rightly allowed other students the same facility,"" he added."

While scrutiny of start-ups has been intensified like never before at most institutes, some are insisting on knowing companies' joining dates. Students say that not many start-ups are keen on hiring due to the fund crunch in the market. Public sector units (PSUs)+ that were missing during campus placements for a few years owing to a high court order, will be making a comeback this year with cells focusing on the 'Make in India' initiative.A placement co-ordinator at IIT-Delhi, Shefali Jindal, said that the institute will be seeking joining dates on company registration forms itself. ""Though they always gave tentative dates, we are planning to get them in writing,"" she said. She said that they had a very unfortunate case on the campus last year, when a student who had a loan burden, bagged an offer with a pay package of Rs 12 lakh per annum, but was rendered jobless after his offer was revoked. At IIT-Bombay, the policy is yet to be finalized, but it will not deviate much from last year. ""We have always examined start-ups, their background, etc. But last year, the number of students whose offers were revoked+ , though not very significant, was more than what it was in the previous years. We have intensified the scrutiny process this year and we are also looking at reviews of start-ups who have shown interest in our institute, on various platforms,"" said a placement committee member from the institute. IIT-Roorkee, too, will be having an additional filtering process for start-ups this year, said NP Padhy, a professor in charge of placements, adding that students have not lost interest in them. The head of the placement committee at IIT-Kharagpur, Shovan Panigrahi, said that the start-ups plan for a period of 18 months and due to the fund crunch, they do not wish to take chances. On the contrary, the institute in Kharagpur, has increased its focus on the PSUs. ""Till now we have invited about 90 firms from various sectors in manufacturing, fabrication, metal, electrical, etc,"" said Panigrahi. IIT-Bombay and IIT-Delhi too will be having several PSUs visiting the campus during the first phase of the placement season this year depending on their availability."

""We are now also looking at self-financing colleges affiliated to a university.But, the issue of rent is a problem as we don't provide rent. We only align with institutions that have a social orientation,"" added Rajesh.The MoU entered between IGNOU and colleges is such that the college will provide space to set up a study centre free of cost.

New clause inserted in draft statute of Jadavpur University,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/New-clause-inserted-in-draft-statute-of-Jadavpur-University/articleshow/53623675.cms,"KOLKATA: Raj Bhavan in consultation with the state government has included a fresh clause dealing with ""service and discipline"" inserted in the draft statute which was sent to the chancellor's office by Jadavpur University. This has once again raised ruffles among stakeholders — teachers, officers and non-teaching staff —who see it as yet another instance of vendetta politics.It is likely that the same clause will be introduced in the statute of other state run universities soon.The clause states that any employee found guilty of ""unethical propagation"" of views against the interest of the university and policies of the state government are liable for punishment that may also take his job. JU teachers see this as a ""draconian step"" to stifle non-conformist views in the mass media, a step that is likely to be replicated in other state universities as well. The state government had earlier tried a similar restriction on state government college teachers that didn't work out as planned. ""The university has received the draft statute from the chancellor's office a week ago, copies of which have been distributed among the stakeholders for their opinions and observations. The draft statute that will govern the university once it is final has a clause on service and discipline of employees that was not sent by the university. According to procedure, copy of the draft from Raj Bhavan will be tabled at the university's highest policy making body — The Executive Council, along with the opinions of the stakeholders. The university will then send its views to Raj Bhavan,"" a JU officer said. The Jadavpur University Teachers' Association has called a general body meeting on August 12 to discuss the draft statute. ""We have called a JUTA general body to discuss and debate on the draft statute. We may seek legal opinion if necessary."" A Juta office-bearer said. What happens if the executive council differs with the clause? Those running university administration maintain that the university is well within its limits to send its views. But the final statute will be drawn up by the state government in consultation with the Raj Bhavan. The final draft will then go for vetting to the law department. The primacy of the state government in finalising the statute is because the government has happens to be the funding agency. However, this does not apply to the academic freedom, universities enjoy. Next comes the need for student discipline. The draft statute also makes a mention of a code of conduct for all the stake holders including students, the first step of which is to introduce biometric attendance for teachers and staff. The Mamata Banerjee government may table a Bill in the Assembly session touching upon the broad contours of the code of conduct applicable to all state universities. The Bill once adopted will require all the state universities to incorporate the clauses in their revised statute. A section, however, believes that the call for discipline with the punitive clause doesn't come without reason. ""Chancellors have time and again appealed to JU stakeholders, particularly students to refrain from gherao and recurrent agitation that cast its shadow on the convocation programme also. The present chancellor sent a word of caution to students during the fracas over screening a film inside JU campus. He urged students to go back to their classrooms because such behaviour didn't go well with the university's image. JU stakeholders didn't pay heed to the suggestion. Instead, a section of teachers fuelled anti-establishment sentiments,"" a JU employee said."

DUTA executive announces boycott of evaluation process for 4 days,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/DUTA-executive-announces-boycott-of-evaluation-process-for-4-days/articleshow/52390016.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi University Teachers' Assocation has announced boycott of evaluation in DU from Tuesday, May 24 to Friday, May 27, in protest against the new UGC Gazette Notification amending the UGC 2010 Regulation that alters work-load requirements for college teachers. If the governemnt doesn't listen, teachers may even boycott the admission process.Teachers argue that the changes are likely to impact quality of teaching and global rankings worldwide; lead to massive retrenchment of teachers and a ""skewed"" student-teacher ratio.The gazette notification increases the workload for assistant professors from 16 hours of ""direct teaching"" per week (including tutorials) to 18 hours plus another six of tutorials, bringing the total up to 24 hours. Similarly the work hours of associate professors has increased from 14 to 22. ""Tutorials have been made optional and practicals devalued by counting only one hour for every two. This will drastically reduce the individual attention that students can get and will lead to a significant lowering of standards,"" says a statement from the DUTA which is coordinating with national-level teachers associations to initiate a movement.Physics teacher and elected member to DU's exective council, Abha Dev Habib argues that the over 50% increase in workload for existing permanent teachers will mean ""a proportionate amount of retrenchment of ad hocs and temporary staff."" ""It means that very few of the students currently in research will get hired and that, in turn, could lead to fewer students joining higher education,"" she says adding, ""We are certain this is the direct result of the over 50% fund cut for the UGC.""The DUTA will also hold a general body meeting on Saturday, May 28, to decide on further course of action and also review the decision on the boycott. ""We don't want to boycott, nor delay results. But if the government wants the results to come early, let them consider our demands. This gazette notification treats two practical classes as one. All ad hoc teachers -- 3,000-4,000 of them -- may find themselves without jobs. Even permanent may faculty in certain departments may become surplus,"" says Rajesh Jha of Academics for Action and Development."
"Question mark over new chairman: IIMA proposes, Smriti disposes",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Question-mark-over-new-chairman-IIMA-proposes-Smriti-disposes/articleshow/52475855.cms,"MUMBAI: A fresh controversy threatens to mark Smriti Irani's tenure as Union HRD minister. This time it involves the country's premier management institute. The Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) has rejected the proposal to appoint IIM Ahmedabad's next chairman from among the names suggested by the search committee. A search panel headed by former IIMA chairman and CMD of L&T; Limited Anil M Naik had forwarded names of three business tycoons — R Seshasayee, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Infosys, Deepak Parekh, chairman, HDFC, and Pawan Munjal, CMD, Hero MotoCorp, as potential candidates for the post of new chairman. According to IIMA sources, this is the first time that MHRD has dismissed the idea of appointing a chairman from a shortlist of three top-notch and powerful business personalities of the Indian corporate world. At present, the chairman and managing director of pharma giant Cadila, Pankaj Patel, is interim chairman of IIMA. As a process under Memorandum of Association between MHRD and IIMA, a search committee formed by the institute shortlists three names and MHRD reserves the power to appoint a chairman from the shortlisted candidate. The Chairman of IIMA oversees and solves all policy related issues at the institute. The Chairman also supports various initiatives of the institute and helps getting resources to ensure smooth functioning. The director of IIMA reports to the chairman, who is head of the Board of Governors. ""We were all waiting to hear about the appointment of the next chairman from among the names chosen. Instead, we were informed that the shortlist did not please the top bosses. This means, the whole process of forming a search committee and shortlisting three names will have to be repeated. We came to know about it when we received an email seeking (fresh) suggestions for the next chairman,"" said a source close to the development and who did not wish to be quoted. This reporter has seen the said email. While MHRD's rejection will delay the process of appointment of IIMA's next chairman, sources close to the development said that either the MHRD is ""not happy with the process followed"" in shortlisting the candidates or wants to appoint a candidate associated with the political party. ""When we received the email suggesting more names for the chairman's post, the first thing that came to our mind was that we would soon be recommended names of businesspersons close to the BJP,"" said a senior faculty member who also refused to be identified. ""IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Bangalore are the only two IIMs in the country where the institute has the power to shortlist the candidate and the MHRD takes the final call on appointment. At other IIMs, appointments are made by MHRD directly. So, here, when they rejected names suggested by the committee, it seemed as if they wanted a greater say in the matter,"" said the senior faculty member. The four-member search committee is headed by Naik and comprises Sanjay Lalbhai CMD, Arvind, Pankaj Patel, CMD, Cadila Healthcare who was appointed chairman of IIM Udaipur recently, and D Shivakumar who is chairman & CEO, Pepsico India Holdings. Naik chose to step down from the post of the chairman in January this year. In March, IIMA board of governors appointed Pankaj Patel, CMD of Cadila Healthcare as the interim chairman. Patel will continue on the post until the next chairman is appointed by MHRD. A detailed email query to IIMA's interim chairman Pankaj Patel and director Ashish Nanda received a one-line response saying the institute would not like to comment on the matter."

In high demand: From fine ideas to working models,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/In-high-demand-From-fine-ideas-to-working-models/articleshow/52299723.cms,"It's that time of the year again, when students have to make choices that will define their careers. To have many choices is wonderful but when the options are many, and several appear compelling, making an informed decision is a challenge. TOI's 'Mission Admission' guides students through the season. Today's focus: Industrial DesignEver broken a toy car to see how it actually works? Or wondered how a three-legged stool balances itself or how a bicycle moves? If you spent your childhood pondering over how things work or tearing things down, industrial or product design might be the right choice for you.Industrial designers develop concepts and designs for products. They specialise in one product category, such as automobile, furniture or housewares. While product design is often confused with industrial design, experts say product design is a sub topic. Industrial design encompasses anything man-made right from products to complete ecosystems.""With Make in India, innovation has become the buzzword and design thinking is key to innovation,"" said BK Chakravarthy, professor, head and institute chair professor, industrial design centre (IDC) at IIT Bombay. With technology taking centre stage in most fields, Chakravarthy says students are taught to use design thinking and problem solving skills to address users' needs. From designing a residential garbage collection device to a waterfetching aid for rural women; using ceramics and glass to design housewares; working with leather to design car seats; building an entertainment console for a vehicle; a motorcycle helmet design; design for a metro train or using animation to narrate stories -the possibilities are endless.Most colleges have an entrance exam such as the CEED which is held annually by IITs and the Indian Institute of Science. The test is designed to gauge one's visual thinking, creativity and comprehension skills. Experts suggest maintaining a portfolio of any work that would show an inclination for design.Through the course, students learn to work with different materials using various machines such as looms, dying machines, printing machines, metal and woodwork. Courses are designed to focus on green manufacture or sustainability. Students are trained to go through the process of converting an idea into a reality.A course in industrial design is not just about design though. In most colleges, students get to choose sub disciplines. For example, at Srishti School of Design, while the first year is all about building the foundation, in the 2nd and 3rd years, students can choose which studio they want to work in. ""Each discipline offer studios and workshops such as photography, camera for films, public space design, electronics, etc. So a student is free to follow his interest and see how it pairs with industrial design,"" said Naga Nandini, course leader, Industrial Arts and Design Practices at Srishti School of Design.At IDC, besides tailor-made courses that can be pursued based on one's interest, the course is project oriented. ""We try to find practical solutions to real-life issues and a lot depends on how well we understand the end user,"" said Chakravarthy. For one of their project, students at IDC designed signages for a hospital in the city as part of their project work.What is key to success in a design career is curiosity and the ability to think in a multi-directional view, say experts. The world is a freeway for industrial designers, say experts. From leading a design team as chief design officer to heading an R&D; team in any field or going the start-up way by becoming an entrepreneur, the options are numerous."
Dentist surplus forces freeze on new colleges in India,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Dentist-surplus-forces-freeze-on-new-colleges-in-India/articleshow/52317522.cms,"MUMBAI: Unemployment has entered the health sciences sector. With supply outstripping demand and no work for new dental graduates, India has decided to stop all new dental colleges. The firm stand was taken recently at the general body meeting of the Dental Council of India which grants permission to new institutes. The decision follows requests from several existing colleges that wanted the council to reject fresh proposals for more institutes, as well as the high rate of unemployment among dentists.India currently has 309 dental colleges, which churn out around 26,000 dentists every year. The count was as high as 30,570 in 2010. In 1970, only 8,000 dental students graduated annually.  ""It would be a good idea to consolidate our numbers now and strengthen the existing institutes,"" said Dr Mansing Pawar, DCI member and dean of Government Dental College. An exception could be made for states like those in the north-east that do not have any dental college, he added.    Some estimates suggest that India has 3 lakh dentists, but there is an imbalance in their spread. In 2004, India had one dentist per 10,000 people in urban areas and one dentist per 2.5 lakh people in the rural areas. It was not long ago that the good times were rolling for dentists. It is now, however, estimated that there will be a surplus of more than 1 lakh dentists in India by 2020. The DCI, on its part, has been trying to trim growth for some time now. In the last two years, it has only permitted new colleges with an attached medical institute to foray into the dental stream. But that was not enough.""Mushrooming of dental colleges in the past few years in India has led to unemployment among Indian dentists. Thousands of dentists are coming out every year with very low prospects of jobs,"" noted Namrata Dagli in her paper 'Increasing unemployment among Indian dental graduates'.Former acting DCI president Dr Mahesh Verma, who is the current director of the Maulana Azad Dental College, said the time has come to ""not vitiate the problem and build on what we have"".""Over the years, we have created a huge manpower of dentists and job avenues have shrunk. There is not much opportunity for today's passouts, except if they want to start their own practice, which too isn't easy. It needs money, space, infrastructure and the right attitude,"" he added.""Self-practice in urban areas is not very easy due to saturation of the dental market. In rural areas, private clinics are not viable because of low awareness of oral health among the rural population. Dental graduates are facing serious financial constraint. Unemployed dentists are left with no choice but to quit their profession and work in call centres or commit suicide,"" added Dagli, in her paper which appeared in the Journal of International Oral Health."

Some students carried their books along and were seen studying during the sit-in at the university's Kedarpur campus. The protests continued on Thursday, a day after vice-chancellor V K Jain told TOI that the university authorities were ""open to reviewing and examining"" the provisions in the prospectus which students find harsh. The students have been protesting against some provisions in the Students' Discipline and Conduct Rules' mentioned in this year's prospectus that bar them from participating in demonstrations, hunger strikes, or raising slogans. Navneet Rajouria, a PhD student enrolled in the economics course, said, ""The vice-chancellor is on leave and some university officials are trying to suppress our agitation.

He added that students will be starting a signature campaign to garner more support for their cause.The students said that they would continue their agitation as the university is yet to give a response on whether it would be revoking the rules. ""We have written down our demands and handed them to the university authorities but we are yet to get a response. We have also demanded that elections for the students' union be held within 40 days of the new semester that begins in July,"" said Mohit Pandey, a student.

As per the timeline fixed by the apex court, AICTE is supposed to take a decision by April 10 but it delayed the process and passed the order on approval only on May 15.Taking a strong exception to the Council not complying with its order and playing with the careers of students by delaying the approval, a bench of Justices P C Ghose and Amitava Roy directed AICTE to file response within a week why it should not be held up for contempt of court.""Don't take us for granted. We would be extremely ruthless to you. We would call your officers and start contempt proceedings. Don't play hide and seek with us. We are not sitting here for nothing,"" the bench said and directed the counsel appearing for AICTE to explain why there was around one month delay in granting approval.The apex court had way back in 2012 fixed a time schedule for granting approval and affiliation to technical education institutions to ensure that there was no delay in academic session. It had also fixed schedule for conducting entrance examinationS and admission process. It had ordered that admission process must be completed by July 31 and academic session must begin from August 1.Despite the apex court's order for strict adherence to the time schedule for grant of approval as well as for admissions, the direction is not being implemented in letter and spirit, with authorities failed to adhere to the timeline and the colleges have to approach SC every year against AICTE for not taking decision on time.Slamming it for working ""casually"" in granting approval to colleges, the court said there was a serious lapse on the part of AICTE and it may be directed to pay cost for playing with the careers of thousands of students in 621 institutes in Uttar Pradesh.""You change our order every year. How can AICTE tinker with the timeline fixed by us. We are the final authority on this issue. We cannot tolerate defiance of our order and we will take action against officers of AICTE for violating our orders. Let the officers learn a lesson of their life,"" the bench said directing AICTE to file response giving explanation for not complying with its order.The Court passed the order on a plea of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University, which grants recognition and affiliation to technical institutes in Uttar Pradesh, seeking extension of time to grant affiliation due to delay on the part of AICTE. Advocate Amitesh Kumar, appearing for University, told the bench that it needed ten days more time to complete the process. As per the calendar, the affiliation is to granted by by May 15 every year.Accepting the plea of the University, the bench extended the deadline and directed the University to grant affiliation to technical institutes by June 10."

With the ministry's intervention today, the direct teaching-learning hours for teachers will once again revert to the older format - Assistant Professors (16 hours) and Associate Professors/Professors (14 hours). The HRD ministry said in a statement that it has issued a direction to the UGC, under Section 20(1) of the UGC Act, 1956, to undertake amendments in the Regulation- UGC (Minimum Qualifications for appointment of teachers and other academic staff in universities and colleges and measures for the maintenance of standards in higher education) Regulations, 2010. Teachers were required to allocate 6 additional hours per week, beyond the direct teaching-learning hours, on research. These hours can now be also utilized for tutorials/remedial classes/seminars/administrative responsibilities/ innovation and updating of course contents, the ministry added.DUTA expressed its dismay at MHRD's response and stated that the ministry discloses the fact that these amendments are based on the recommendations of the Nigavekar Committee. ""The Nigavekar Committee's notoriety is widespread in the teaching community as the Committee refused to have any consultation with, or register the concerns of, teachers' bodies like AIFUCTO, FEDCUTA and the DUTA.""Claiming that the MHRD has hastily put a stamp of approval on the Committee's unilateral exercise of modifying the APIs, the teachers' body stated that by excluding tutorials from 'Direct Teaching' hours, the amendments have, in one fell blow, destroyed the only system of small-group interactions between students and teachers. The system of tutorials has been integral to the practice of mentoring and catering to the individual learning needs and challenges of students.It also stated that science teaching will take a hit due to devaluing of practical and laboratory training.The teachers into their third day of evaluation boycott alleged that by recommending a lecture-centric teaching load for API targets, the amendments have insidiously provided a basis for a Quantum reduction in Workload, a step which endangers the job-prospects of 50% of the existing faculty in DUDUTA statement also said that the ministry has deliberately concealed the fact that this Notification was accompanied by the UGC's express instructions to college principals that the second tranche of teaching posts sanctioned under the OBC expansion scheme were being withheld indefinitely. The DUTA sees this underhand move as further indication of the MHRD's intention to downsize faculty without any regard to the quality of education."
No government quota seats in private colleges for MBBS and BDS,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/No-government-quota-seats-in-private-colleges-for-MBBS-and-BDS/articleshow/52474432.cms,"BENGALURU: Here is a bad news for students, 12 private medical colleges and 24 dental colleges which come under the umbrella of COMEDK will not share its MBBS and BDS seats for government quota from this year. The Karnataka Professional Colleges Foundation (KPCF) announced this decision on Thursday. This means the common entrance test conducted by Karnataka Examination Authority will be valid only to fill the seats in 15 government medical colleges.MR Jayaram, secretary of KPCF told reporters that this year NEET will be conducted to fill the MBBS and BDS seats in private colleges and all these developments (SC's direction of conducting NEET and NEET ordinance) have taken place after the consensual agreement was signed between KPCF and the state government to share the seats. ""But now since NEET is conducted for private colleges this consensual agreement is invalid,"" he said. He said as per the Supreme Court directions 15% seats will be reserved for NRI students. Of the remaining 85% seats, not even a single seat will be shared as government quota in the private colleges.Recently, the union health minister JP Nadda, after the NEET ordinance was passed has stated that the government quota seats will remain the same in private colleges. But KPCF pointed out that in the ordinance it is mentioned that there will be government quota, but no where it is mentioned that what is government quota and about the percentage of seats to be reserved for government quota.But the good news is, of the 85% seats (excluding NRI quota), 50% of the seats will be reserved for SC, ST and OBC categories. This means it would be easy for students belonging to this category to get medical and dental seats in private colleges. There are around 1,500 medical and 1,600 dental seats in private colleges.AS Srikanth, chief executive of COMEDK said COMEDK will do the counselling for MBBS and BDS seats in private colleges after the NEET results are out and an oversee committee formed by the state government will monitor it, this will ensure more transparency. ""We will follow the fee structure fixed by the Fee Fixation Committee, which is also formed by the government."" The committee has already submitted the report to the government.The counselling dates will be announced after the COMEDK results will be announced."

She scored 100 in Physics and Chemistry, and 99 in English, Maths and Computer Science.  Born and brought up in Delhi, Sukriti followed a basic routine and never emphasised on the concept of studying for long hours. ""I never studied for any specific number of hours. I focussed more on utilising those hours in doing something productive. The credit goes to my school teachers for constantly helping me out and my parents who stood by my side as the pillar of strength,"" said Sukriti. Her mother Renuka Gupta was a Physics topper of her batch and father Rakesh Gupta was a Rajasthan board topper. ""I am feeling great. We never pushed her hard to emerge as a topper and constantly kept motivating her to do better. Now that she has topped on All India level the feeling is great,"" said Renuka Gupta. Unlike many students who would isolate themselves during board exams, Sukriti says she enjoyed every aspect of her life. ""I used to watch TV, play games and travel even during my boards. I don't think so isolating yourself will help. You can't study all the time as it becomes tiring after certain point of time so there is a need for extra curricular activities to keep your mind fresh,"" she said."

Neet: Lobbying by prvt medical colleges to thrive on NRI quota,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Neet-Lobbying-by-prvt-medical-colleges-to-thrive-on-NRI-quota/articleshow/52456363.cms,"VIJAYAWADA: The all-powerful private medical colleges managements now began pulling strings to let the Neet be not a hindrance to their roaring business by way of literally selling medical seats in the open market. As an initial move, the Andhra Pradesh Private Medical Colleges Managements Association got health minister Kamineni Srinivas to hold a meeting with its representatives here on Thursday to thrash out certain impediments caused by the union government's ordinance over medical admissions through the Neet under management quota (C-category). The minister, according to sources, took a break from the Collectors conference, which was underway, to meet the management representatives of private medical colleges. Sources from the minister's office said the meeting failed to find a solution to the Neet-induced issues and that the minister reportedly promised to address them within two-three days by taking them up with the union health minister Jagath Prakash Nadda.The ordinance insists on entertaining admissions under both Categories -A and B only through the second phase of Neet, phasing out the NRI quota. In fact, it is only the NRI quota which is the mainstay for the business prospects of private medical colleges as each seat under the quota is permitted to be sold for a price ranging up to Rs 2.5cr by the government. The quota with 310 seats means a business of Rs 500cr every year.But the ordinance seeks to look at the NRI quota the other way round. It allegedly turned out to be a big racket and a notorious fraud with hardly any student with NRI background admitted under the quota. Allegations are galore that the NRI quota is a euphemism for collection of capitation fee which was banned the government. As per the guidelines, the seats under the quota should be filled with NRIs as a first preference followed by their dependents and those sponsored by them. According to Medical Council of India (MCI) former member C L Venkata Rao, it has become so fraudulent that there are not more than 2 per cent of NRIs out of 310 seats under the quota in the State.The government through the ordinance is understood to have decided to let merit prevail with respect to 15 per cent of the NRI quota with the admissions through Neet only by doing away with the practice of private medical colleges to fill those seats at their will with only money as a criterion. However, the managements of private medical colleges contend that admissions through two different streams in a single class with different exam patterns and syllabi amount to subjecting the students to denial of equal opportunities. It may be recalled that the private medical colleges are bound to fill the B-category seats also through the Neet=based ranking along with those under A-category based on Eamcet ranking.Uncertainty, according to the managements association, also prevails over the fate of fee structure presently in force for the B-category seats because of admissions through the Neet. When the Admission fee regulatory Committee (AFRC) allowed the private medical colleges to collect Rs 55 lakh for the five year bachelor degree under the B-category, the ordinance on Neet however is said to be mum on the fate of existing fee structure. Besides, the fee structure under the particular category varies from the state to the state with no parity. In Telangana, for instance, it remains at Rs 45 lakh. A leader from the association on condition of anonymity said private medical colleges would become unviable if the present fee structure is not maintained in line with the AFRC recommendations."

CBSE X boards: Huge drop in Delhi's pass percentage,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/CBSE-X-boards-Huge-drop-in-Delhis-pass-percentage/articleshow/52485693.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi has the dubious distinction of being a bottom ranker in the zonewise ranking of pass percentage in CBSE Class X board exams. The region's success percent of 91.76%, significantly lower than last year's 96%, is higher only than Guwahati's at 83.79%. Delhi had the largest number of candidates among all states - over 2.85 lakh - and also the largest number of students from government schools: 1,43,024. The pass percentage of 89.13% in government schools was lower than the 95.43% in the capital's private schools. ""The drop in pass percentage in Delhi can be attributed to the clause that a candidate has to secure at least 25% marks in the summative assessment to pass a subject,"" said Ashok Pandey, principal of Ahlcon International School, Mayur Vihar. However, he felt that if the trend showed ""continuous decline"" in the future, it might point to the non-detention policy mandated by the Right to Education Act being behind the fall in the success rate.CBSE has not revealed the zonewise distribution of students who have scored CGPAs of 10 this year. The number of those getting the highest possible CGPA 10s has increased massively across the country, and there is a generous number in Delhi as well. Jyoti Arora of Mount Abu Public School thought that this was because ""children are better adjusting to the system and that has increased participation."" In the continuous comprehensive evaluation system, students are assessed throughout the year, but the final exam - the so called summative assessment - can be either board or school-based. Question-papers are centrally set, but in the board-based system, the evaluation is external, while in the school-based exam, the school teachers mark the papers. Candidates have to secure at least 25% to be promoted. ""Three-fourths of the work is done in school, so we already know where our children stand,"" said Tania Joshi, principal, The Indian School. Amity International, Mayur Vihar, has 78 students who got a CGPA of 10; Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj, 73; DPS, Dwarka, 72; Amity, Pushp Vihar, 57; Ahlcon International, Mayur Vihar, 53; Springdales, Pusa Road, 47; Rukmini Devi Public School, 44; Mount Abu Public, 40; Amity, 39; Manav Rachna, 17; The Indian School, 10; S R Capital, nine; and Evergreen Sr Secondary School, Vasundhara Enclave, 13.

Health dept looks at detailed health as subject in school,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Health-dept-looks-at-detailed-health-as-subject-in-school/articleshow/52347595.cms,"BENGALURU: Concerned about increasing lifestyle diseases, especially among youngsters, the health department is looking at introducing health as a subject for school children.While the proposal is in the preliminary stages, UT Khader, health minister, said that the department was looking at introducing the subject in schools during the coming academic year.Speaking on the sidelines of the 115th anniversary celebration of Shathayu Ayurvedic treatment centres, Khader said parents played an important role in ensuring the health of the future generation, but today's parents were either not fully aware or did not have the time.""If not at home, the idea is to teach children about health at least at school. It is not enough to simply tell them to wash hands before and after eating, or to have a shower everyday. These will be covered in primary sections- but as the child grows, they also need to be taught about how, for example, sugar affects their body, what metabolism is, what they can do to improve metabolism, lifestyle diseases and how to protect oneself from them and so on,"" Khader said.According to Khader, the lack of guidance and awareness was also contributing the increasing diseases. ""Everyone is a doctor today and suggests anti- biotics for various diseases. There used to be a time when plants were used to cure minor illnesses like cold or cough and so on. Today nobody even remembers these plants which had huge medicinal value,"" he said. He added that the role of Ayurvedic medicine was especially important considering that it also focused on preventing factors that caused many lifestyle diseases. ""Although Ayurveda is often considered the last resort in medicinal treatment, with greater awareness and more accessibility, it could become the first, at least for minor illnesses,"" he said.In an effort to make Ayurvedic medicine more accessible and affordable, the health department has proposed to construct 50 bed Ayurvedic hospitals within the campus of District hospitals across the state and 10 bed Ayurvedic centres in taluk hospitals as well.Construction of hospitals in Chitradurga and Mangalore was sanctioned in the last budget and will begin this year, he added.Former health minister HC Mahadevappa observed that close to 25-30% of our children were malnourished. ""What kind of nation can we build when our children are not healthy?"" he asked, adding that Ayurveda had simple solutions in medicinal plants which were also not expensive. Liver care and management: Improving the health of our livers will improve our overall health, according to Dr Mruthyunjaya Swamy, Managing Director, Shathayu Ayurveda.""Today's health concerns are lifestyle diseases as opposed to infectious diseases, which is reducing thanks to advancements in medicine. Toxins in food are absorbed by our liver, which becomes sluggish, causing metabolism related problems. Eventually, the liver becomes unable to even absorb the medicines we are taking,"" he said.As part of its liver care and management programme, Shathayu will not only provide focused treatment, but will also begin awareness and training programme for doctors in liver care.Over time, the plan is to expand research into pain management, women and child and infertility issues, he added.Shathayu has also dedicated an 8 acre property to grow and develop medicinal plants."

Delhi University colleges that have them, will make their computer laboratories available for online admission.Candidates will have to upload scans and copies of over a dozen documents -- a first in DU -- in addition to filling a significanly more detailed online form. ""Students can go to any college that has a computer laboratory or centre and seek assistance. Colleges will help as much as they can,"" says admission committee-member, R N Dubey. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College principal, SK Garg, says the computer centre and even staff at his college will be available to help. Unlike for the nursery-school-level EWS admissions, applicants may not have to hit the internet cafes.As will be student organisations who have traditionally used the application-helpdesk route for recruitment and expansion. A system in which applications into even extra-curricular activities (ECA) and sports quota will be filed online makes college-level help-desks unviable. Consequently, more student organisations are moving to other spots, mainly metro stations. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad will have 14 desks across Delhi (two to a zone) with most kitted out with computers and printers and net-enabled. ""We will fill the forms for applicants but they'll have to pay on their own. We can't ensure scanner everywhere but even phones can be used for scanning,"" says ABVP spokesperson, Saket Bahuguna adding, ""Although the process has been moved online, students still visit. In North Campus, we'll have one centre at Arts Faculty and another at the metro station.""In fact, metro stations will be the new centres for admission seekers and student activists to meet. The National Students Union of India will place its helpdesks at the stations closest to colleges. ""DU gets many outstation candidates who like to visit the campuses, get familiar and figure out what facilities are available,"" says NSUI spokesperson Neeraj Mishra. They will also establish a helpline for each zone.The North-East Forum for International Solidarity, too, will have helpdesks -- with computers and scanners -- but in Assam and Manipur. ""We are already counselling students and hleping them fill forms. In Delhi, we'll only give out helpline numbers,"" says Chinglen Khumukcham of NEFIS.If applicants can get to any of these centres, there are schools. Tania Joshi of the Indian School has told her students they are free to use the resources of the school to apply and upload documents. ""I had a kid call me today and she was quite upset ubout the uploading. This is the first batch and while most kids will have computers and access to the net, they may not have provisions for scanning etc.,"" says Joshi, ""I've told them they can come to the school and do it any time they like."""

Only students with 75% or more attendance will be able to evaluate their teachers. UGC will shortly notify the modified API. Sources said, ""The existing API despite few amendments in the past was not favourable to teachers who only do teaching and was also resulting in poor quality research and publication in all sorts of academic journals.""In the new API, under the category of teaching/learning/evaluation a teacher will have to annually get 100 points at the level of assistant professor, 90 at the level of associate professor and 80 for professors. Student evaluation has been introduced and the five sub-categories of earlier API has been made four. Categories of co-curricular activities and research earlier evaluated together will now be evaluated individually as well as collectively depending on certain factors. Sources said that in the earlier API too much subjectivity was involved in case of co-curricular activities with college principals and vice-chancellors often acting as final authority. Now it has been simplified and scores have been reduced. Also, evaluation of these two categories will not be done annually. Even new field of co-curricular activity has been introduced to inculcate value education. The new fields are sports, NSS, NCC, field trips and few others.In case of research, sub-categories remain the same but cap of minimum score from each sub-category has been removed. For instance, in earlier API a teacher had to get 55% from research papers/publications, 20% from research projects, 10% from research guidance/undergraduate dissertations and 15% from training course and conference/seminars. Now a teacher can score from any sub-category. Also, to ensure that research papers are not published in shady journals, UGC will be listing out the name of peer-reviewed national and international journals where publications can take place. Also, for the first time research journals in Indian languages will be included."

Bihar gets central agriculture university while Parliament makes history,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Bihar-gets-central-agriculture-university-while-Parliament-makes-history/articleshow/52243897.cms,"NEW DELHI: In what could possibly be a rare example of passing a bill by both Houses of Parliament the same day, both Rajya Sabha andLok Sabha passed the Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University Bill on Wednesday. Even President Pranab Mukherjee gave his assent to it the same day — making it a rarest of the rare case in Parliamentary history.The legislation, meant for upgrading the existing Rajendra Agriculture University (RAU), Pusa, Samastipur in Bihar as a central university, gave the state its first central agriculture university. ""The central agriculture university is a big gift for the people of Bihar. It has fulfilled their long pending demand"", said the Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh. Bihar, happens to be the minister's home state, recently also got the Mahatma Gandhi Central University in Motihari. Singh told TOI: ""It is honour to the state which got two central universities, including one central agriculture university, in the name of two great men — Mahatma Gandhi and Rajendra Prasad"". The legislation, a historical one for Bihar, will also be remembered as one of the rare Bills which could not only be passed by both houses of Parliament on the same day but also got the President's assent the same day. ""Passing of a bill by both Houses of the Parliament on the same day can be done by waiving of rules (like giving minimum time to members of other House to vet it through prior notice). After all, House is the master of the Bill. If a House decides to take up a particular bill the same day, it can take it up"", said PDT Achary, constitutional expert and former Lok Sabha secretary general. Asked by TOI to recall any other Bill which might have been passed by both Houses of the Parliament on the same day, Achary said though couple of Bills might have been passed in similar situation in the past, he could not recall any such case at least in recent past.The Bill was first passed by the Rajya Sabha and hours later, the Lok Sabha also approved it unanimously without any discussion on Wednesday. Since the Lok Sabha was to adjourn sine die on Wednesday itself, the minister was keen to get it approved. The bill was introduced in the Upper House in December last year.According to new legislation, the headquarters of the university will remain in Pusa, Bihar. It will have powers to establish campuses at such other places within its jurisdiction as it may deem fit provided the university should integrate the existing campus and other associated facilities of the RAU."

Marks obtained in class XII board examinations will no more influence a candidate's position on merit lists in medical admissions.

Officials said that unless the Centre intervenes, all admissions in medical courses will be completely based on NEET scores from this year onwards.

There will be a common merit list at the national level for the 15% all India quota.Health minister Nitin Patel said that he, along with education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, will go to Delhi and ask the Union government to intervene so that relying solely upon NEET is not made compulsory for this year. The Gujarat government would also move for NEET conducted in Gujarati.The state government will also ask the Centre to remove any cut-off criteria, or at least lower the cut-off criteria for students from Gujarat. ""We will also make representation that the 85% seats in the state barring the 15% all India quota, be filled with students who have appeared for their examination from Gujarat,"" said Nitin Patel.The Admission Committee for Medical and Paramedical Courses (ACMPC) had earlier prepared a merit list based on the marks obtained in the class XII examination and also the marks obtained in Gujarat Common Entrance Test in the ratio of 60% and 40%.

Addressing a poll campaign meeting in Tirunelveli on Thursday, she said it was her government which had taken steps to ensure that the common entrance tests were abolished and a special act was enacted to protect the welfare of the rural students. It was in the interest of these students that the AIADMK government issued an order to do away with entrance tests for these courses. In 2006, a special act was enacted for the same issue and the selection for the medical and BDS courses were conducted based only on the plus two results since 2007.The Medical Council of India announced that a nationwide entrance examination should be conducted for entry into these professional courses on Dec 27, 2010, which was opposed by many state governments. ""The efforts taken by the government headed by me resulted in the Supreme Court dismissing the MCI order on July 18, 2013,"" she said. But the former UPA government, in which the DMK was a part, filed a review petition in the court. Now, in another case a three-judge bench has ordered that a common test be conducted throughout the country on May 9, 2016.DMK leader M Karunanidhi, who was in the habit of seeking political gains out of any situation, was now blaming the AIADMK government, saying that it had not argued the case properly in the Supreme Court, when it was the DMK which had been a part of the UPA government when the MCI passed the order for a common entrance test in 2010, she said.Listing out the benefits brought to the people by her government, Jayalalithaa said every single vote that went to the DMK would be something that was going against the welfare of the people and the children of the state.All our schemes have been aimed at uplifting the poor people of the state, while the DMK manifesto was one that had been chalked out to fool the people."

A bench of Justices A R Dave, Shiva Kirti Singh and A K Goel said NEET does not infringe upon the rights of state governments or private institutions and that the single-window test must be applied from the current academic year itself. The bench also asked the three-member oversight committee, headed by former Chief Justice R M Lodha, to oversee NEET-II. Several states, universities and private colleges conducted entrance tests in the last fortnight when the SC was hearing their pleas to allow them to admit students on the basis of their tests, but Monday's order nullifies them. Now they will have to follow NEET and admit students on the basis of their performance in the single-window test.Although NEET II is scheduled for July 24, the Supreme Court allowed CBSE and Centre to reschedule the examination date in case of logistical problems. Exams by AIIMS, PGIMER will be validThe Supreme Court bench on Monday made it clear that those students who had appeared for NEET-I held on May 1 would be allowed to take second phase of NEET but their marks in previous test would stand scrapped. ""To allay any such apprehension, we direct that all eligible candidates who could not appear in NEET-I or have apprehensions that they had not prepared well, be permitted to appear in NEET-II, subject to seeking an option from the said candidates to give up their candidature for NEET-I,"" it said. However, examinations conducted by AIIMS and PGIMER for their MBBS seats would go on as they are regulated by Central legislation. ""Prima facie, we do not find any infirmity in the NEET regulation on the ground that it affects the rights of the states or the private institutions. Special provisions for reservation of any category are not subject matter of NEET nor rights of minorities are in any manner affected by NEET. NEET only provides for conducting entrance test for eligibility for admission to the MBBS/BDS courses,"" the bench said. The top court refused to modify its April 28 order which directed implementation of NEET for 2016-17 academic year itself. It said that NEET only provides for conducting entrance tests and it did not violate special provisions on reservation in colleges and rights of minority institutions. ""To ensure total credibility of the examination to be held by CBSE, the oversight committee appointed by this court shall also oversee NEET-II examination to be conducted by CBSE,"" it said."

The Powai campus for the first time looked at the beliefs and lifestyles of its incoming batch to find that most students were moderately liberal when it came to their political views and 75% of them were comfortable with the idea of homosexuality and/or homosexual marriages.The survey looked at diverse topics such as students' background before joining IIT, their political and religious beliefs and post-grad plans. In all, 254 of the 875 freshmen who entered through JEE participated in the survey.""The survey aimed to understand the institute's demographic better. It's important so we can see how we're growing as an institute and what demographic we are catering to,"" said Shreeyesh Menon, Insight chief editor. The quintessential IITian has changed over the years. A good 60% don't believe in religious practices and another 30% ""somewhat"" follow them. But when it comes to the idea of God, 18% are atheist, 35% are agnostic and 47% believe in God.

Life before IIT-B was largely about JEE, with 40% spending four to seven hours daily and 30% dedicating between 7 and 12 hours to prepare. Of those who cracked the exam, 21% took a year's drop from school to solely train for the JEE. ""For nearly all our respondents, their own expectations put pressure on them to crack the JEE,"" the survey found.

Students, faculty and those in the field of education voice their opinion about introducing a common all-India entrance examination for engineering courses as well. While some say it should be introduced, others feel NEET is not required for engineering examinations.Form an apex body to frame common syllabiIt would be better if there's a common entrance for engineering aspirants as well at the all-India level. Instead of writing many exams to get into B.Tech courses, conducting only one test throughout the country will relieve both students and parents from stress. However, before starting a countrywide test, one must ensure that the syllabus is the same for all states. Moreover, conducting the test in the regional languages would help those students who have been studying in their vernacular languages. At present, there are all-India entrance examinations conducted by IITs, BITs and other deemed universities. But the disparities in syllabi of these examinations make the students reel under undue pressure. Therefore, there should be an apex body at the all-India level for framing of the syllabus and preparation of question paper. - K Rama Mohan Rao, Academician NEET not required for engineeringEven though making NEET mandatory for entrance to medical courses would be a boon for students, there's no need to extend the same for the engineering courses because in India, we already have two all-India exams for IIT and NIT, which has around 10,000 and 20,000 seats respectively. Besides, the states conduct Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE) for admissions to the engineering courses. The two states of AP and Telangana have 3.2 lakh seats in engineering and students need to qualify EAMCET to get into a good engineering college. There are enough engineering colleges unlike the limited number of medical seats and good medical colleges. - G Ramalingeswara Rao, College deanNEET syllabus has a holistic approachThe stand taken by the central government and upheld by the Supreme Court on NEET is a welcome one and is expected to bring benefits to all stakeholders including students, parents, professionals and the general public. NEET would obviate reasonably the problems arising out of the present system in terms of quality and competency. I support NEET for engineering courses as well for the same reasons. Having a national syllabus gives a holistic approach to education, equity and improved access to education. Writing one engineering examination instead of multiple ones for different institutes would be easier for students as well. However, keeping NEET in view, upgradation of plus two syllabus is also required. - KVL Raju, Engineering college principal Financial burden on students will reduceStudents prepare for various entrance examinations after finishing their Intermediate to get seats in top colleges like IIT, NIT or other deemed universities. Parents also spend a lot of money for their children's education and for various coaching centres. If NEET is introduced for engineering courses, the financial burden faced by students would be reduced to some extent. The expenditure incurred by parents for their children's entrance preparations would also come down because there will be only one common examination for all engineering colleges. - M Mahesh, StudentTwo exams for engineering requiredStudents have to face a lot of problems regarding entrance examinations. After our Intermediate, we have to write several examinations like AIEEE, EAMCET, B.ARCH, NATA and so on to get into a good college/university. Along with these examinations, there are also university entrance examinations. Writing only one test like NEET may help reduce the burden, but it should also ensure that the deserving students irrespective of their caste get a fair chance to get admissions to a good college. Also, for engineering, I feel it's better to conduct a specific examination for a particular engineering/medical discipline. For example, NATA is only for architecture. That way, students would be writing only two tests - one to get into engineering and the second to get into the course of his/her choice. - Kolli Manju, StudentInterest of the aspirants matters mostThere is already a national eligibility-cum-entrance test for admissions to IIT and NIT by the name JEE and it is conducted by the central government. As per the existing provisions, institutions of engineering and medicine can be established by the Centre as well as the states with the approval of UGC/MCI as the case may be. If the basic idea is to bring in quality medical education, the Union government may first take over all the government medical colleges in the states and then proceed for NEET on the lines of JEE.

However, the environment becomes relatively complex and the child faces a variety of social, interpersonal, physical and emotional problems which need to be resolved. Schooling is only a part of the broader educational activity and mainly concerned with meeting the instructional objectives of education. Regular Guidance and Counseling, if provided at this juncture, can help the child in maximizing his/her capacities and in Self-Actualization.CBSE has stated that it is the first and perhaps the only board of education in the country which has been providing psychological counseling services to the stakeholders since 1998. At present, the programme is run in two phases: Phase-I at the time of preparations and during examinations, and Phase-II at the time of declaration of results.The multiple-mode services of the board include telephonic counseling, online counseling, and support material on CBSE website and Question & Answers Columns in leading newspapers.One of the major strengths of this 'outreach' programme is the voluntary, free of cost service provided by the principals, trained -counsellors. The counseling services not only provides psychological support to students and parents but also help the board in defining trends and improvements when real time responses are analyzed .It is learnt that with the purpose of gauging the need and scope of the support services available in the affiliated schools, the board has designed a questionnaire to map the existing guidance and counseling facilities and all schools are expected to cooperate and fill these forms by May 20."

However, in this case vice-chancellor RL Hangloo, appointed by this government, has threatened to resign alleging political interference on the issue of method to be adopted for admission.Even as political parties across ideological divide, including BJP, are ranged against Hangloo, he himself did many flip-flops on Wednesday. First he blamed the Centre for interfering in university's admission policy but later changed it to political interference in general.While talking to presspersons, Hangloo said, ""HRD ministry should not have interfered. We will all have to leave and let the university be run by government as it wishes. Then it would be better to have MLAs and MPs as vice-chancellors rather than academics."" In no time he issued a clarification by taking an unprecedented decision. Hangloo sent a letter to Rajya Sabha chairperson Hamid Ansari stating that neither HRD minister Smriti Irani nor ministry officials have ever interfered in the working of the university.He blamed media for twisting his statements. By evening Hangloo was back to blaming political parties, including BJP for mess in Allahabad University. ""This is a central university and used to be called the Oxford of the East in the past. There can be no possibility of the institution regaining its lost glory if political interference continues,"" Hangloo said.Allahabad University had introduced admission only through online method this year. However, many BJP MPs met Irani on Tuesday and sought her intervention. After ministry sent him a missive that offline test should also be there, university had to modify its earlier decision. However ministry sources said it had merely suggested that online tests can be introduced from next year.Student leaders across political divide had opposed only online admission test. Leaders were alleging that online test will intrinsically benefit urban and semi-urban students while those from rural background will be left behind because of lack of internet connectivity.The matter came up in Rajya Sabha. Irani sparred with SP leader Ramgopal Yadav. She alleged SP leaders had threatened Hangloo while he cited VC's statement alleging interference from the Centre."

School principals share IIM learnings,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/School-principals-share-IIM-learnings/articleshow/52133405.cms,"NEW DELHI: The 60 school principals, teacher educators and officials who attended leadership training at Indian Institute of Management (Lucknow) in April 2016, have gained as much from interacting with each other as the programme itself.In a meeting with the education minister, Manish Sisodia, on Thursday, they related what worked for them, what didn't and the changes they planned after the sessions. Principals have planned meetings with mothers, story-writing sessions and student elections in schools although some were a touch skeptical about being instructed by a business school.The principals wished their trainers were more conversant with the circumstances in which they function and the extreme poverty many of their students live in. The principal of a boys' school in Tikri Kalan organised for extra water supply with the Vidyalaya Kalyan Samiti funds because many of his students came from homes where there was none. ""I asked them to bring extra bottles and fill for home as well,"" he told Sisodia and officials to unanimous appreciation but admitted that this measure was taken before the training.Several presentations were planned -- the teachers have returned with formidable PPT skills and a veritable lexicon of b-school cliches -- Sisodia asked speakers to cut through the 'theory' and get to ""concrete steps"" they have taken, motivated by the programme. Kavita Rana introduced ""class panchayat elections"" in her school, Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Vasant Vihar. ""We set up an election aayog, even had election symbols and students filed nominations,"" said Rana. Sarita Batra has decided on a ""mothers meeting"" at the Sultanpuri School she heads. Director, education, Saumya Gupta suggested including fathers too because ""mothers are inherently enlightened"" and ""fathers pose a bigger challenge."" Batra also intends to start a ""story-writing and story-telling"" initiative. ""Stories have more impact than debates or discussion. Children will write stories that'll be with others in the assembly. I'll also encourage the habit of reading. There are kids who finish school without ever checking a book out from our library,"" she said.However, feedback on the programme, was not entirely positive. ""We need to know what was good and what was bad about the programme. And we'll communicate it to IIM and the teams from IIM Ahmedabad and Cambridge University who'll be in Delhi soon,"" said Sisodia encouraging school leaders to ""be critical.""Batra pointed out that the content ""had to be specific."" ""We asked the organisers why they didn't take information from us before starting, ask us what we expected,"" she said and a rumble of assent went through the crowd. ""It should have been conducted in two rounds with time in between for us to test our skills and give feedback. Also, they should call a person from our background, who worked in the same conditions but did extremely well."" Seema Srivastava, from the State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) agreed that the trainers deployed at IIM ""didn't know much about government schools."" But presentations from teachers, told SCERT ""where the gaps are and how they may be addressed."""
